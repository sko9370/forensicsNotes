   questions. 
2. Familiarity with Linux tools and the ability to building custom tools and
   solutions.

## Lab Environment

- Same machine as lab 1.
- All files are in `/cases/lab3`


## Background

Wireshark is a great tool for manual network forensics and traffic analysis.
However, it isn't always the right tool for the job.  Specifically wireshark is
less well suited to the analysis of large captures and presents few
opportunities for automation.  If your analysis needs to be repeated, you'll
probably want to script a solution.

All the questions in this lab can be answered with only command line tools. If
you would prefer to write a simple program that is also sufficient.

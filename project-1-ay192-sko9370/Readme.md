# Project 1

This is an individual semester long project where you write code to address some
forensically relevant problem. You will also post about your progress along the
way in a format suitable for a public blog.

## Project Philosophy

In this project you will propose, design, and implement a tool, or
a modification to a tool, that addresses a forensically relevant problem.

The goal of this project is to reinforce that anyone can be a “tool creator” and
one need not be limited by what is available. This deep understanding of the
interaction, use, and creation of software to perform forensic tasks prepares
students to be adaptable in real world scenarios.

This project will require writing code as well as presenting the creation. You
are free to choose a topic across the entire breadth of the subject matter and
are not limited to the topics covered in class. This is an opportunity to dive
deep on a subject of interest. The only requirement on topic selection is
a connection to digital forensics and instructor approval.

The intent is not to duplicate the experience of the Capstone Project but rather
to provide another, less constrained, venue where you can apply their
skills on a topic of personal interest.


## Posts

Rather than submitting a final project report you will capture your progress on
this project through 3 separate "blog" posts. The intent is that you write as if
you were publishing this project for the world. Your 3 part blog series will be
broken down as follows.

### Post 1: Idea (40)

In this first post you are capturing the motivation, the problem statement, and
what you plan to build. This should include ample references to related works,
as well as a clear plan of how you plan to accomplish the project. Make clear
the "so what" about your contribution and why it is valuable.

After reading this post someone should want to continue following your progress.

### Post 2: Progress (30)

As you work towards building your tool you will undoubtedly encounter unforeseen
challenges, additional related work, and learn new concepts. This post should
capture all these elements as well as where you are in achieving the plan you
set out. By this point you should certainly have some code written and some
preliminary results.  It is ok for not everything to be working and to identify
where your initial assumptions were invalid. However, there should also be
a clear path forward to achieving your end state. 

After reading this post someone should know what you've built and should be
eager to see your final results.

### Post 3: Results (30)

This is your summarization of the project. Your code is complete and ready to be
used by others. This post should convey the status of the project and indicate
how your tool can be used. Your final approach to solving the problem should be
clear and any future work or next steps should be identified.

After reading this post someone should know what your end result can do and  how
it addresses the problem statement you identified in your first post.

### Submission

All posts should be at least 750 words and submitted in plaintext markdown files
in this repository. The grammar and formatting should clear. Spelling should be
correct clear. It is allowed, and encouraged, to include screenshots and
graphics in your submission.

Though formatted as blog posts, there is no requirement that these be posted
publicly.

## Presentation (25)

You will provide a 10 minute at the conclusion of the project. The presentation
is your opportunity to explain your motivation, approach, and demonstrate your
tool.

There is no fixed format, and you are encouraged to include demonstrations and
visuals. You are required to turn in any slides or materials that you use.

## Code and Execution (125)

The majority of your grade for this project will come from an evaluation of your
tool and the execution on your stated plan. Essentially assessing did you
achieve what you set out to. Were you able to build a tool or capability that
answers a forensically relevant need.

There are no restrictions on the programming languages used. The tool can be
stand alone, or serve as a plugin for an existing tool or framework. The program
can provide a direct use or inform some automated analysis.

You code should be submitted in this repository, including documentation, usage
instructions, and any other necessary artifacts.

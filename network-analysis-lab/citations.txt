On question 4, I was having a hard time getting rid of the garbage on the right side of the html titles.
I first considered reversing and then running cut again, but I experimented with the factors option without reversing and found that I could just catch the "<" and the output would only contain the html titles!
I learned the rev and cut command from this post (little did I know that "cut" was the actual command I needed to clean the output) but only needed to use cut.

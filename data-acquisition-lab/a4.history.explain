The bash history is accessible directly from the home directory if you use ls -al but I didn't know about it until I started up a webserver on the index.html file that showed the directory for hidden files. Bash history is something that shows exactly what an attacker might have done to compromise a system. Knowing that, this is definitely a file that I would edit or destroy if I were attacking a system to rid of any incriminating evidence.

**Points:** 125

### Minimum

In order to achieve the minimum score of 70% you must:
- Solve at least 5 x 100+ point challenges
- Submit write-ups for at least 5 x 100+ point challenges, in accordance with
  the requirements below.

### Scale

After achieving the minimum requirements you can earn more points as follows:
- Score 600 points = 80%
- Score 700 points = 85%
- Score 800 points = 90%
- Score 900 points = 95%
- Score 1000 points = 100%

### Bonus points

You can earn 5 additional (grade) points for write-ups after the initial 5, up
to a total of 15.  This includes challenges that are worth less than 100 points.

## Rules
- This is an individual event.
- **DO NOT** help your classmates or ask for any assistance from them.
- You are encouraged to seek assistance from the instructors as necessary.
- You may use internet resources freely.
- **DO NOT** post any information related to these challenges online.

## Write-Ups

- Create a directory in this repo for each challenge write-up.
- Include a script (bash, python, ruby) or source code (C, C++, Java) that
  solves the challenge and emits the flag, if possible.  The intent is to
  automate the solve as much as possible.  Document what could not be automated.
- Write-ups should detail not only how to solve the challenge, but also document
  attempts you made to solve the challenge that were unsuccessful.
- Use the [writeup-template.md](./writeup-template.md) as a starting point.

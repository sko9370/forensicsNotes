Retrieving the files using icat was easy.

Xor'ing the files was a bit more challenging.
Not really, I just looked it up and there was a python script.
It just took a while to go back and read the directions again.

When I cat'ed the xor'ed file, the flag was the first line or so of text.
The rest was unreadable.

Going through the pcap on wireshark, I found 2 large packets.
I assumed these were carrying the picture somehow.
I followed the TCP stream.
I tried exporting the jpeg conventionally but it didn't work.

I exported the raw bytes from the entire stream.
It showed up as a jpeg on my desktop and the flag was viewable.

## arparparp

Use wireshark.

All of the source ip's look the same because of the fake arp packets.
Then I noticed that the source MAC address were all different.
I filtered through all the UDP packets according to "eth.addr."
Looking through data, :03 doesn't look promising, next try.

:05 had individual letters that made up words.
Looking through all the packets gives the message and a flag.

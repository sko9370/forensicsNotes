a. What type of file is this?
This is a Windows 7 DOS/MBR boot sector.

b. How did you determine and confirm the file type?
I ran file on file001 which showed that it was an MBR and then ran hexdump -C file001 to verify the last 4 bytes were 55 and aa.
Stat file001 also revealed that it was 512 bytes.

c. What relevant information does this file contain?
This file contains information about the OS of the machine it came from, the partitions and their sizes, and also that it was corrupted or invalidated somehow.
Stat also shows that it was last modified in 2016-01-28, which may be because the year wasn't properly updated when this vm was set up and the files were moved in.

a. What type of file is this?
This is a "Composite Document File V2 Document."

b. How did you determine and confirm the file type?
I used the file command to determine the file type.
File was also able to get a lot of metadata from the document which confirmed that it was some sort of document file.

c. What relevant information does this file contain?
The file command reveals that the file was created by Michael Robinson on a Mac using Mac Excel.
The last modify date was 2015-10-23 according to stat command, but file command says 2015-10-07 was the last saved date.
This disparity could hint at some suspicious editing of the file that the author or secret author wanted to hide.
Further analysis of this file should be done before attempting to open it in the actual application.

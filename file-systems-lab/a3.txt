a. What type of file is this?
This is the MBR of a DOS/MBR boot sector.

b. How did you determine and confirm the file type?
I used the file command to determine that it had information about different partitions.
The hexdump revealed that the last 4 hex values were 55 and aa, indicative of MBRs.

c. What relevant information does this file contain?
The strings command revealed that the filesystem type was NTFS, which is commonly used by Windows.
The file command used the "cluster" term, which Windows also uses as well to describe sectors.
The serial number from the same command could also possibly be used to track down the purchase location.
The BOOTMGR was compressed for some reason and the system entered some sort of error state.
It seemed that the disk was corrupted somehow.

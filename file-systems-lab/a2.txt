a. What type of file is this?
This is a DOS/MBR boot sector.

b. How did you determine and confirm the file type?
I used file to get the file type and then ran hexdump -C file002 to verify that the last 4 bytes are 55 aa. The size is also 512 bytes.

c. What relevant information does this file contain?
The file contains information about the size and location of the 3 different partitions.
Using stat, the modified date shows up as in 2016, but that's probably because the file was created/moved before the system got a chance to sync with the network date/time.
hexdump -C seemed to be leaving out some output, so I ran hexdump -vC to display all the data.
The zeroes seem to indicate some data was very consciously erased from this disk.
Normal users would not use this method because it takes longer and makes data irrecoverable.

Scalpel was able to recover many times the number of valid files, so it was the more successful tool.
However, one of the files it recovered was invalid (the tif file).
Photorec was able to find some files that scalpel did not find, especially some with different file types.
Scalpel seems to have more customization options, judging from its man page.
This could be useful when you only want to glean specific types of files in cases where the search space is very large (1 tb disks).
If given the time and resources, scalpel should be run first and then photorec should be run after to gather the largest number of recovered files.
